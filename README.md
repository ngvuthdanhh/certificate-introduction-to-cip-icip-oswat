## 📝 Personal Review
This course expanded my understanding of **Critical Infrastructure Protection** by covering both **physical and cyber domains**.  
The mix of labs, policies, and compliance exercises helped bridge the gap between **theoretical standards** (like NERC CIP, NIST CSF) and **practical security implementation**.  
It is highly valuable for anyone pursuing **cybersecurity in OT/ICS and national infrastructure security domains**.
