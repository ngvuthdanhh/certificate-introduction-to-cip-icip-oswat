# ⚖️ Risk Assessment Lab

## Objective
Practice identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks for a critical infrastructure system.  

## Tasks
1. List 5 assets in a power grid (e.g., control center, substations, SCADA servers).  
2. Identify at least 3 threats per asset.  
3. Assign **likelihood (1–5)** and **impact (1–5)**.  
4. Build a **risk matrix** to prioritize risks.  
5. Suggest mitigation measures (technical + organizational).  

## Expected Outcome
Students will be able to create a **basic risk assessment report**.
