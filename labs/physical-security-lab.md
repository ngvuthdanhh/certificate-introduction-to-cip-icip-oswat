# üõ°Ô∏è Physical Security Simulation

## Objective
Understand physical security layers and how they protect critical infrastructure.

## Tasks
1. Draw a **physical site map** for a power plant.  
2. Place at least 4 security layers (perimeter, access control, monitoring, redundancy).  
3. Describe how a breach at one layer affects others.  
4. Propose improvements (guards, CCTV, barriers, biometrics).  

## Expected Outcome
Ability to **design and evaluate** physical security controls.
