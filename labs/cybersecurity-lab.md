# ðŸ’» Cybersecurity Lab for ICS/SCADA

## Objective
Simulate common ICS vulnerabilities and defenses.

## Tasks
1. Analyze a **sample ICS/SCADA network diagram**.  
2. Identify weak points (open ports, lack of segmentation).  
3. Suggest improvements (firewalls, VLANs, MFA).  
4. Discuss how to detect and mitigate malware like Stuxnet.  

## Expected Outcome
Understanding of **network segmentation and defense** in ICS/SCADA.
